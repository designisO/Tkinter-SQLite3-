## Tkinter & SQLite3 

In this project, I was able to create an program that allows users to add their first name and email to a database. The front end was built using the python module Tkinter. The database was created using SQLite3 which is serverless. While working on this program, I was able to learn how both the GUI and the databases work together. Tkinker is a module thats included in Python programming language. Enjoy.
